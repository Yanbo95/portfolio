                Yellow Crane Tower is located at the top of Snake Hill, Wuhan. It is one of Four Major Towers in China, which is 51.4 meters high with five storeys. Poets in the past dynasties have written many immortal poems here. Standing at the top of the tower, people were easily to expresses homesick and ambitions. Yellow Crane Tower consists of the main tower, Pei Pavilion, veranda with windows, memorial archway, Nanou Tower, and veranda with poem styles. Although it has been repaired and rebuilt for 10 times, I still felt the culture and history behind three Kingdoms Period.
