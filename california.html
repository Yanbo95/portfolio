                I was so excited to take the journey of Universal. Universal studios Hollywood is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood film studios still in use. I have watched again Harry Potter movies and the Simpsons before experienced the theme parks in Universal Studios Hollywood. 9 rides, 7 shows, and a large outdoor play area simulate real movie scenes. Also, each lot features a collection of rides, shows and attractions as well as food, beverage, and merchandise shops.

                The world-famous Hollywood Walk of Fame features more than 2,500 celebritiesâ€™ names in the sidewalk along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street, which were just in front of the gate of my hotel. It was not like the attraction gathering much crowded, because it can be visited 24/7, no wonder it was rank the No.1 visited attraction in the US. I found the star of my favorite actor, Will Smith, and felt closer to my idol.

                The Hollywood sign is a landmark whose white block letters are familiar around the world as the prime symbol of the movies. Also, this sign has inspired many people who love movie industry to pursuit their Hollywood dreams. I enjoyed the views from Griffith Park, in the middle of the hills, and looked to position for the best possible angle on the sign. More than any other sight in Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign in the background of your photo proves you were really there.

                I found this interesting huge tables and chairs in social media and put this museum, The Broas, in plan of Log Anglos journey. The Broad is an inaugural installation featuring more than 250 masterworks of contemporary art. For the inaugural exhibition, the founder, Joanne Heyler has selected more than 250 works by some 60 artists to present a sweeping, chronological journey through the Broad collection.
