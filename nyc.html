                The first place I would like to introduce is the Empire State Building. It is a supertall skyscraper in New York City. It had been the tallest building in the world for almost 40 years. It has 86th floor and 102th floor for observation decks, while other floors are commonly being used for office spaces, and broadcasting. In festivals or special events, the upper portion of the building will always be lit with different colors for celebration or memorial. I was surprised that I could see what happened almost in the near avenues, and I enjoyed the lights of the city when I was at the top of Empire State Building.

        <div class = "bull text">
            <p>
                Next destination is Wall Street. Besides hundreds of companies and economic institutions located in this world financial center, Wall Street Bull is another attracting spot, and the people who has ambitions in financial industry must visit. This three-and-a-half-ton bronze sculpture symbolizes "the power of the American people" and represents the spirit of New York, where anyone can come, work hard and succeed.  The bull is also a symbol of a strong stock market in which participants are optimistic and confident. I hope I can succeed good luck from bull to start my first career.

                I walked through Brooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan and had a picture with beautiful skyline of Wall Street. This bridge is first steel-wire suspension bridge in the world, which made it convenience for commuters. The lower side is used for cars, and people can walk and bike in the higher side. This iconic feature of the New York City still carries roughly 150,000 vehicles and pedestrians every day.

                One of my favorite attraction in New York is Vessel. This modern structure was just completed in March 2019. 150-foot, bowl-shaped, honeycomb-like interactive artwork made Vessel unique. Comprising 154 interconnecting flights of stairs, the installation will offer a variety of ways to engage with the cityâ€™s urban landscape. When I climbed, I found every landings had different views, no matter from inside Vessel or to outside Vessel.
